                Peter is an orphan raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May in Queens, New York. A brilliant but
                socially
                awkward teenager, his life changes forever when he is bitten by a radioactive spider, granting him
                extraordinary abilities, including super strength, agility, wall-crawling, and "Spider-Sense."
                Initially, Peter uses his powers for personal gain, but after letting a thief escape, the same
                criminal
                later kills Uncle Ben. This tragedy teaches Peter a profound lesson: "With great power comes great
                responsibility." Determined to honor his uncle’s memory, Peter becomes Spider-Man, using his
                abilities
                to fight crime and protect others.
                While fighting villains such as Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom, Peter also juggles the
                struggles of daily life, including school, work as a freelance photographer, and his relationships
                with
                friends and loved ones.

                        Tom’s Spider-Man is the most youthful and energetic portrayal, closely resembling the comic book
                        version. Integrated into the MCU, his version of Spider-Man interacts with other Marvel heroes,
                        making him a key figure in the cinematic universe.

                    Stan Lee conceived Spider-Man as a unique superhero inspired by seeing a spider crawl up a wall. He
                    wanted a relatable hero who dealt with ordinary problems like money, school, and relationships while
                    also fighting crime. Initially, the idea was rejected by publishers, who thought spiders were
                    unappealing.

                    However, Lee included Spider-Man in the final issue of Amazing Fantasy, which became an unexpected
                    hit. This success led to the launch of The Amazing Spider-Man comic series, cementing Spider-Man as
                    one of Marvel’s most iconic and beloved superheroes.
